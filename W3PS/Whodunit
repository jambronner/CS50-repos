## What's `stdint.h`?

-- Definitions of standard functions for integers

## What's the point of using `uint8_t`, `uint32_t`, `int32_t`, and `uint16_t` in a program?

-- 'uintX_t' tells program the number of bits to reserve for an unsigned interger (i.e. no negative value)
-- 'int32_t' tells program the number of bits to reserve for a signed integer (pos or negative)
-- Since int32_t is referencing LONG, it is being used to provide width and heigh dimensions...that might be negative?

## How many bytes is a `BYTE`, a `DWORD`, a `LONG`, and a `WORD`, respectively?

--Byte = 1 byte
--DWORD = 4 bytes
--LONG = 4 bytes
--WORD = 2 bytes

## What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denotes bfType, which specifies the file type. BM in ASCII or 0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal 

## What's the difference between `bfSize` and `biSize`?

bfsize is file size (in bytes)
bisize is image size (in bytes)

## What does it mean if `biHeight` is negative?

It means the order of the image is reversed, so that the top row of the image is the first row in memory, followed by the next row down.

## What field in `BITMAPINFOHEADER` specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of
	bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.

## Why might `fopen` return `NULL` in `copy.c`?

fopen will return NULL if it cannot create the outfile to write to.  This might occur if the file does not exist

## Why is the third argument to `fread` always `1` in our code?

This is the number of elements (i.e. number of RGB triples being read)

## What value does `copy.c` assign to `padding` if `bi.biWidth` is `3`?

biWidth is the width of the bitmap in pixels. If the width is 3, padding is necessary since
	the scanline must be a multiple of 4.
  If biwidth = 3 and size of (RGB triple) = 3, the formula: (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
  is (4- (3*3)) %4) %4 = (4-9) %4 %4 = 1 % 4 = 3

## What does `fseek` do?

So that padding isn't put in between every pixel, fseek skips over padding until it's needed

## What is `SEEK_CUR`?
It moves the file pointer to a specified distince away from the current position.  In this case, it's moving the pointer to [padding] away from current position so that padding is skipped over.
